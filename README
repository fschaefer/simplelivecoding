    A Processing tool that allows to "live watch" a sketch.
    
================================================================================

    Sketches written in basic mode can be run and watched live
    in the PDE allowing for a sort of live-coding workflow.

    SLC is currently not ready for Processing 2.0 ... i'm working on it.

    Latest stable currently is 0.0.6, which works with Processing 1.5.1:

	SLC had it's first public appearance at Node08 where Casey convinced me to 
    join the patcher kutcha: http://vvvv.org/documentation/node08.patcher-kutcha

	SLC has been used in the wild:

	2011-2012 - Live coding sessions at the National Center for the Arts (MX) - 
    Juan Manuel Escalante (Realität) - random appearances -

    2012 - "Live coding with Processing" / 
    Workshop at "/* vivo */ :: Live Coding Symposium" by 
    Juan Manuel Escalante (Realität) Media Lab / 
    National Center for the Arts / MX -

    This tool is based upon the idea and demo by Florian Schäfer
    posted to the Processing Discourse years ago: http://bit.ly/Q7rsu4
