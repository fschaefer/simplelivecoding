    A Processing tool that allows to "live watch" a sketch.
    
================================================================================

    Sketches written in basic mode can be run and watched live
    in the PDE allowing for a sort of live-coding workflow.

    SLC is currently not ready for Processing 2.0 ... i'm working on it.
    
================================================================================

	SLC had it's first public appearance at Node08 where Casey made me join 
	the patcher kutcha: http://vvvv.org/documentation/node08.patcher-kutcha

	SLC has been used in the wild:

    This tool is based upon the idea and demo by Florian Sch√§fer
    posted to the Processing Discourse years ago: http://bit.ly/Q7rsu4
